### Summary

Merch ordering app: Usually in clubs, it is super hard to keep track of the merch that people want. I am thinking of a way that a user can post a merch with price and description on a board, and other users can choose to pre-order how many merch they want to buy and tag along their Venmo id for example. The sellers will manually check off the orders if he/she receive the money on Venmo, and the buyers can see the orders updated as “payment verified”. Also for the merch info, we can add fields for pickup location and pickup time. Sellers will also manually check off the orders that have been picked up by the buyers.
